        In a shocking turn of events, the famed ecoterrorist Sinn Chatreya and
        her militant group “The Ferals” launched a violent raid on Balumian
        Corp.'s high-security laboratory, releasing a powerful interdimensional
        entity. The attack has left the city and the world in chaos.
      </div>
      <div class="medium-long"></div>
      <div class="medium-long text">
        Chatreya, a notorious anarcho-primitivist, led the assault team
        comprising professional mercenaries and her loyal followers. The group,
        heavily armed with submachine guns, grenades, and high-tech equipment,
        stormed the facility at dawn. The mercenaries, hired through the dark
        web, and The Ferals, executed a meticulously planned operation,
        infiltrating the building from multiple entry points, according to our
        sources.
      </div>
      <div class="medium-long"></div>
      <div class="medium-long text">
        The primary target was the Nexial Gateway, a cutting-edge device,
        developed by Balumian Corp, which has been in the eye of a media storm
        in recent months, after its highly controversial development from
        obscure hallucinogens like DMT, or N, N-Dimetiltriptamine by
        neuroscientists who claimed to have found the instructions during
        experiences of drug abuse. The 512-million-dollar device in question is
        allegedly capable of interdimensional communication and travel, although
        many experts deny these claims as preposterous and unscientific. The
        attackers overpowered security, locking staff in an auditorium and
        sweeping through the facility to secure the Gateway, located in the
        heart of the building.

        Upon reaching the Gateway, Chatreya, with assistance from her followers,
        activated the device. Injecting herself with a powerful dose of
        dimethyltryptamine (DMT), she triggered the interdimensional process.
        Witnesses reported a surreal phenomenon as the Gateway emitted radiant
        energy, summoning an entity identified as PI RU RES.

        The being, a colossal and abstract form of shifting neon lights and
        strange, polygonal structures, began to materialize, breaking through
        the laboratory's ceiling. Its presence caused widespread panic and left
        onlookers in a state of euphoric paralysis.

      <div class="medium-long"></div>
      <div class="medium-long text">
        The entity's emergence had immediate and profound effects on Jakarta.
        The surreal apparition, visible across the city, disrupted electronics,
        causing widespread malfunctions in communication networks and digital
        systems. Social media platforms and other online services were inundated
        with bizarre, corrupted data.

        Sinn Chatreya, an eco-anarchist with a history of violent protests
        against industrial and technological progress, aimed to unleash the
        power of the Nexial Gateway. Her group has previously engaged in
        high-profile acts of eco-terrorism across the globe, from halting
        logging operations in the Amazon to disrupting mining activities in
        Mongolia.
      </div>
      <div class="medium-long"></div>
      <div class="medium-long text">
        According to the Feral's blog and Twitter, Chatreya's actions were
        driven by a radical ideology she termed “Presentism,” advocating for the
        abolition of industrial progress in favor of a return to a more primal
        state of existence. Her ultimate goal appears to be a societal
        transformation through ecstatic experiences induced by the entity.
        Thousands of followers around the globe consider that her actions are
        well justified, after the failure of the UN and most governments to
        contain the catastrophic consequences of climate change.

      <div class="large text">
        Indonesian authorities, alongside international security forces, are
        investigating the full extent of the incident and working to neutralize
        the entity. Experts warn that the implications of this event could
        reshape global approaches to both security and technological
        development. As the world watches, the release of PI RU RES in Jakarta
        stands as a stark reminder of the potential dangers posed by unregulated
        advancements in interdimensional research. The incident underscores the
        urgent need for international cooperation in managing emerging
        technologies that can transcend conventional understanding and control.

        The eidolon was colossal. A kind of rhizomatic tubular figure, adorned
        with spheres like nervous knots that branched vertically, interwoven,
        braided, stretching on a dozen long legs of intense fuchsia, lemon
        green, aquamarine blue, all spiraled, twisted, difficult to understand,
        rising immensely in pink spikes that topped it at a height of three

        The monster towered over the posthuman jungle landscape like an ancient
        deity or a sculpture of Yugoslav art. It didn't move, at least not
        perceptibly, but its mere presence produced, if not fear, the disturbing
        sensation that ran down my back and gave me goosebumps, just like
        vertigo or seeing creepy insects moving.

        so we could turn our faces, stop salivating, avoid vomiting, and contain
        the dizziness of its maddening radiation? Like everything else that
        inhabited the presentism and the dreamsphere, it possibly did not
        perceive us in a linearity of time: “we were not about to reach it, we

        it had appeared in section 4.35, sector 2b, on the outskirts of Jakarta,
        “capital” of the Ferals, if that ruin could be called a city, that is.
        Our mission: to recover the Nexial Gate. Nothing less.

        PIZARRO and GAMA were walking with long strides on the right, and I was
        on the left. At first in slow mode, saving energy. We could see
        ourselves in the distance, enormous bluish humanoids, clones of ancient
        celestials encased in neodymium and tungsten armor taking saurian steps
        that made the earth tremble. 45 percent timing. Raising energy levels by
        five powers in three minutes. Activate battle shields on sides. Attack
        mode in five, four, three, two, one.

        Any signs of movement?<br /><br />

        Negative, sir. It's eerily still, but its presence... It's unsettling.

        Luna. Think it'll attack if we make a move? <br /><br />

        Hard to tell. Maybe best to observe from a distance. The radiation's
        messing with my head, makes me feel like I'm something else. Or someone
        else. <br /><br />

        Extraction team's down. Leuktra division's moving in from the north.
        Your mission: recover the Nexial Gate. No compromises.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Captain Benítez</div>
        Roger that. PIZARRO, MAGELLAN let's advance cautiously. Sync at 45
        percent. Energy levels up in three. Activate battle shields on the
        sides. Attack mode in five, four, three, two, one. <br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Kai Luna</div>
        Locked and loaded, sir.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Sánchez</div>
        Ready to roll, sir.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Captain Benítez</div>
        Lieutenant, we're poised. Permission to engage.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Lieutenant (from the orbiting base)</div>
        Hold your horses, Benítez. I see the eagerness. Take a breath.
        Precision, that's what we need. You're handling machinery worth more
        than some nations' GDPs. Let's not get reckless.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Kai Luna</div>
        Things are getting weird. Feels like we're tripping. I suppose it's just
        the dreamsphere, but I thought our caskets would protect us from it.

        It was enough to notice that the place we were walking through was not a
        normal jungle. This had been reported on numerous occasions: in the
        vicinity of an eidolon, anomalous effects could be experienced, a mobile
        interzone extended for several kilometers: folds of chaotically
        contained dimensions, meaningless vibrations like those of a fleeting
        trip with dimethyltryptamine towards the kingdom of the mechanical
        elves, buzzing in the ear as if we were about to confront our
        döppelganger in the back of the mind.

        And I took a deep breath of the antidote gas so that presentism wouldn't
        absorb me. The kilometers that surrounded me of mountains covered with
        lush tropical jungle, omnipresent, endless and so mysterious, were
        giving me a kind of paralysis. I don't know how long I was in complete
        silence, placing my eyes on one detail, then another, on a flower, on a
        root, on the texture of a tree, insects that fluttered here and there,
        greens, yellows, reds so intense. At least a couple of tears escaped my
        eyes, and I breathed deeply, tasting the thick humidity of the air,
        waiting for it to heal me, to transform me.

        The three of us started shooting at the colossus. It was precision fire
        with point-fifty penetration ammo. A single bullet would have split the
        trunk of a large tree. Wisps of blue smoke formed around the bug, which
        began to move unusually, quite quickly, like a gigantic shapeless
        lizard, disarticulating and rearming itself to avoid the projectiles,
        twisting in a second, spinning, opening. Nothing human or biological on
        the entire Earth moves that way.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Sánchez</div>
        Watch it, friendly fire! Friendly fire!<br /><br />
        The colossus danced, redirecting the bullets toward us at high speed so
        that we were forced to move quickly to avoid shooting at each other.
        Other eidolons had done the same. They had learned and each one was
        smarter than the last.<br /><br />

        Roger. Fire!
      </div>
      <div class="large text">
        The kaiju detected the missile, it was as if it turned to see it in slow
        motion, turning its internal eyes to watch it pass, as if in a second it
        had deciphered the operation of the infrared guidance. Everyone saw how
        from one moment to the next it stopped emitting heat. The missile
        brushed past the monster and changed direction for a few degrees looking
        for the nearest heat source and hitting Pizarro. We all saw the
        explosion.<br /><br />

        I fired a burst of yellow light, streaking the Javanese blue sky. The
        bug changed color, caught the light, and turned it into a ball of
        energy. It seemed to hold it for a while inside its psychedelic
        structure and then, twisting the light like a misshapen lens, it
        channeled it and shot towards GAMA. Captain Benítez's enormous robot
        received the impact squarely in the chest. The beam tore through it,
        melting its armor, ripping open the cloned celestial's chest, shattering
        most of the chassis, and expelling its bloody alien viscera. There was
        no time to eject, there was no time for anything. Captain Benítez died
        in an instant. He probably didn't even realize what happened when he
        found himself in the afterlife, without warning, without saying goodbye
        to his loved ones, and without any decorations.<br /><br />
        The giant fell backward with smoke, crashing into a section of the
        forest, and remained there in peace.<br /><br />
        Matías in the PIZARRO unit and I in the MAGALLANES unit, remained
        silent, our robots stood completely still.

        Core's energy to the limbs. Did I ever tell you about my thirty-meter
        katanas, Luna? I mean, Captain. Ehem. Ready to engage! <br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Lieutenant (from orbiting base)</div>
        The team here is reorienting operational armor and activating auxiliary
        arms. You would've had four if you had been more careful. You've got
        thirty seconds.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Kai Luna</div>
        Do what you have to, then get out! <br /><br />
        Then I changed my instance to fight in melee, dropping the plasma
        cannon, the submachine gun, and the missile pods, just in case I also
        needed to intervene.<br /><br />
        The PIZARRO unit, with its three active arms, dashed towards the monster
        with great speed. It swung its swords like lightning, spinning,
        attacking, cutting, and thrusting. The creature dodged with great speed,
        bending most fantastically, displaying iridescent colors, showing
        electric blue membranes full of bright eggs, and reconfiguring its shape
        behind Sánchez's back. He was tired and losing focus. <br /><br />
        <div class="nametag"></div>
        Kai Luna: Combat speed activated!<br /><br />
        I went after him, and drew my fire staff. A rubidium weapon capable of
        causing enormous heat damage to any structure. As I got closer I was
        able to detail that in the thirty seconds of combat he had already
        spent, Sánchez had only been cutting through the air. In the
        thirty-fifth second, the target produced a flash, leaning against the
        ground, it grew one of its appendages to an impossible width, hitting
        Matías in the side with such power that the robot was shot into the air.
        He suffered considerable damage, but as he flew, the artificial
        intelligence calculated the movements of a backflip and it landed safely
        on his feet.

      <div class="large text">
        <div class="nametag">Kai Luna</div>
        You are leaving now! <br /><br />
        I yelled at Matías.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Lieutenant (from orbiting base)</div>
        Yeah. Engage. Take him out of there. Try to spare the machine and pull
        back. <br /><br />
        It was pure luck that I managed to break into the creature's defenses
        and hit it with the fire staff. The bug vibrated like a singing bowl,
        opening like a flower, spinning and preparing to fight me. It jumped
        like a cat while trying to hit me with his iridescent spikes. I dodged,
        and parried, then saw on the mental screen that the PIZARRO unit adopted
        its most powerful pose. It doubled, changing modules, losing weight,
        discarding two or three shells, and becoming a quadruped. A slender,
        black creature with golden claws and hundreds of horns like the branches
        of a tree. The true form of a fluxus.<br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Lieutenant (from orbiting base)</div>
        What are you doing, Sánchez?<br /><br />
        Sánchez: Saving my friend. And your precious mech. Changing modules one
        to five, discarding exterior shells. <br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Lieutenant (from orbiting base)</div>
        That's not even tested in combat. <br /><br />
        <div class="nametag">Sánchez</div>
        Doesn't mean it won't work. This is the true form of a fluxus! The black
        beast of the unconscious! Payback time, baby.<br /><br />
        The PIZARRO unit charged at the kaiju, hitting it with its antlers. As
        he was thrown into the air, I aimed and turbocharged my right arm,
        throwing the staff at it, which chased it along the trajectory and
        buried itself in the heart of the beast. The eidolon fell into the
        jungle, sinking between the trees and taking fire damage. <br /><br />
        We both stood silent, staring at the jungle.<br /><br />

        I activated the retribution mode, found one of Matías's swords in the
        distance and made it fly into my hand like Mjollnir. I took a couple of
        strides with the little energy I had left and found the bug wriggling
        near a river basin, pulsating and throbbing like a mass of fungi and
        vapid organs. I raised the robot's arm and attacked. Halfway between the
        sword and the kaiju, the monster produced a bush of very long aquamarine
        blue spears, which pierced the core of the MAGELLAN unit. My mecha. The
        lights went out in the cabin. Sparks flew, and controls were
        inoperative. There was an alert message in the telepathic system and I
        saw on the mental display how the PIZARRO unit was impaled just like
        mine.

          Sinn Chatreya ate her last burger in a van at the entrance to the
          Balumian Corp. laboratory while she checked the time on her phone,
          over and over again. She was surrounded by hooded men and women, armed
          with assault submachine guns, grenades, signal disruptors, climbing
          equipment, knives, and enough ammunition to kill the entire building's
          staff. Half belonged to a team of professional mercenaries hired in
          the Deep Web. Immortals. The other half were Chatreya's loyal
          followers: The Ferals.<br /><br />
          With her they had participated in a fairly impressive number of
          sit-ins, marches, and protests since she was a fourteen-year-old girl:
          they had faced riot police from several countries (some had lost their
          teeth in those epic confrontations), in perfectly strategic missions
          trying to stop the progress of logging in the Brazilian Amazon,
          seeking to prevent the signing of a law in Mongolia that allowed open
          pit mining, promoting the attempt to close a refinery in Venezuela,
          attacking seal hunters and plastic factories in China. They were a
          formidable group of anarcho-primitivists punk rockers, full with long
          hair, second-hand clothes, pierced genitals and nipples, all united in
          their increasingly firm belief that the only way to stop their mortal
          enemy (pollution, or capitalism, sometimes even technological
          progress), was through violence. Or at least, “certain types of
          violence.”<br /><br />
          Chatreya finished the last bite of the burger. She closed her eyes to
          taste the fat, and the sauces and sent a message to Juno Luna.

          SINN: You have five minutes to get out of there.<br /><br />
          Juno saw the message, and two checks came out, but he didn't respond
          to anything.

          balaclava and AKIRA and Green Peace patches on her blue jean vest.<br /><br />
          —Maybe he'll participate when the time comes, —Ratz added. Ratz was an
          18-year-old boy whose face looked like that of a little rat, and he
          too had opted for the hamburger ritual. Considering animal
          slaughtering was about to be impossible.

          The operation was relatively clean. One group entered through the
          roof, another through the parking lot, and another through the front
          door. Doors were closed, cleaning staff and a few scientists were
          threatened, all of whom ended up locked in an auditorium under the
          angry yelling of two armed mercenaries. The groups swept through
          rooms, storerooms, conference halls, and individual offices until they
          found the security room.<br /><br />
          Despite the planning, the hacking of the surveillance circuit, and
          other details, the police had been informed and were already on their
          way to the scene. They tied up the security officers with ropes and
          gag balls and left them naked in the bathroom. The vault where the
          Nexial Gateway was located was in the heart of the building in a large
          chamber with a very high ceiling, surrounded by instruments that
          monitored its thermal variations, radioactivity, etc.<br /><br />
          The door burst open, and mercenaries and anarcho-primitivists entered
          pointing their assault rifles, placing themselves in positions that
          had been discussed and planned for months.

          Chatreya walked in confidently, still picking food out of her teeth
          with her tongue. She located Juno Luna, with his lab coat and his
          small team of scientists on the second floor. Chatreya looked in all
          directions, familiarizing herself with everything: the cooling tubes,
          the ultra-fast cameras, microphones, electromagnetism detectors, the
          stairs and emergency exits. With everything under control, she finally
          approached the Gateway.<br /><br />
          It was surprisingly small compared to what was seen on the
          international news. Not only images of the machine in operation
          producing the strange blue flower of energy and a lot of circles that
          were drawn in the sky, but of the many guinea pigs, apes, cats, rats,
          who were administered DMT while they were inside the floating rings.
          There were also images of the humans who shone, became diffuse, seemed
          to disappear momentarily before reappearing, washed in sweat,
          shivering with fever and completely crazy, squeezing hyper-objects of
          delicate and strange nature in their hands with such force that their
          palms and nails were cut open and bleeding. What they had glimpsed had
          left them mentally handicapped, ready to be interned in a mental
          hospital. Or at least, that's how it was in the first months before
          they learned how to calibrate the “world selector”.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —It looks like a hula hoop, a hundred and fifty million dollars hula
          hoop —said Chatreya without giving it much importance. Then she looked
          at Juno —if you stayed it's because you're part of the team.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Juno nodded, but that didn't make him happy. He was especially nervous
          about the mercenaries' weapons. After sending that much intel for
          years, he deserved to see the thing first-hand.<br /><br />
          Chatreya looked at the Gateway again and approached it with greater
          interest.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —It's incredible what they've gotten out of it. Did you see that they
          opened an entire university degree just to study objects? —uttered
          Juana.<br /><br />
          —We keep a few of them here —said Juno, as if sparing some time —we
          have the gold octahedron that is factored by 45 every 67 seconds in a
          tank, and we have the ogdoadian filigree that makes everyone vomit
          within a square kilometer, we have it in a lead box. If you are
          interested, I can give you a tour...
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Shht. No time for any of that. The police are on their way.<br /><br />
          She took off her clothes in front of everyone. She walked shamelessly
          naked towards the plexiglass doors that separated the living space
          from the security area. Juana accompanied her, taking out a
          ready-to-use dose of dimethyltryptamine from her yellow suitcase made
          of recycled tires. Once inside, Chatreya touched the rings, noting
          that although they floated, they seemed firmly locked in the air.
          Magic from the advanced room-temperature superconductors. She bent
          down and entered between both rings. Juana took off her balaclava,
          kissed Chatreya in her mouth, and injected her left arm with a large
          dose of the active component in ayahuasca, an endogenous drug of the
          pituitary gland, found in almost every animal's metabolism.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Health and good vision! —She managed to say before the
          interdimensional phenomenon began.<br /><br />
          The discs activated and began to float, lifting Sinn into the air
          before the cameras and the astonished gaze of her fellow activists and
          mercenaries. In the space between Chatreya and the floating disks, a
          source of energy began to appear. Red lines, branches of cosmic
          biotechnology grew rapidly, and a beautiful blood flower opened, with
          fluctuating and strangely polygonal cells of light covering the entire
          hall. From the center of the upper ring, an iridescent and shiny
          membrane then unfolded. Inside, a living being made of orange balloons
          became visible. A fragmentary god, rejoining, rearming, and disarming,
          playing hide and seek with all human civilization in our minds. The
          attendees heard their telepathic voice; terrified, they then knew they
          had made contact on a planetary level with PI RU RES, sentinel and
          observer of the stellar quadrant of Valmuria, the colossus of even
          numbers, our lady of skins. We have already seen it; PI RU RES has
          appeared in our dreams playing god of death and singing its song.

      <div class="row3">
        <div class="small">
          As the enormous, absolutely monumental, abstract, branched, and
          segmented legs of the shifting eidolon began to emerge from the flower
          of light, rising without stopping and beginning to break the ceiling
          that soon started to collapse, it is worth reviewing the training that
          Chatreya had gone through. Just as Juno Luna and her companions had
          spent months deciphering the strange writing, the walls of
          pseudo-computational codes that can be seen in the DMT “trip” that
          eventually gave them the instructions to build the Nexial Gateway,
          Sinn Chatreya was attempting to have functional conversations with the
          gods, elves, symbiotes, dimethyltryptamine aliens. As any psychonaut
          knows, mechanical elves communicate telepathically, and they like to
          talk, sometimes a phrase (which will stick in the psychonaut's mind
          for the rest of their life) sometimes entire conversations, not very
          clear ones, though.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          They are, however, not so good at listening, or, for that matter,
          having a functional conversation. When being asked anything, they
          normally answer something else completely, a 3-meter cactus man might
          talk about universal love, a lizard made of Legos might explain
          something about transcendental happiness, a fox woman made of orange
          bubbles might try to teach a traveler to dance. Chatreya tried to
          explain to the entities that we were destroying our planet and needed
          help. But for months the creatures strayed from the topic and ended up
          speaking to her in rhymes: In cosmos vast, my essence finds its home/
          Where stars in dance, their light forever gleam/ In unity, I merge, no
          longer roam/ With universe, I blend, as in a dream.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          By the way, PI RU RES, had grown so much at that point that it was
          possible to see him, or her, or whatever their pronouns are, from
          anywhere in Jakarta. They glowed a neon red/magenta. They raised their
          legs, branches, things, they had no human or animal form. They were a
          jumble of nerves, spheres, disconnected parts of an alien spine, and
          three yellow spheres like the yolks of giant eggs.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          In the months of training, Chatreya learned the hard way, by
          interviewing insectoids, beings made of sticks, and enormous
          radioactive fish, that eidolon intelligence was more complicated, or
          more mysterious, than human intelligence. When she told the fluoride
          ghosts the details of what capitalism meant, submission to the laws of
          the market, and people's inability to break out of the cycle of buying
          things that depended on the destruction of everything, the monsters
          seemed more interested in showing her the usual hyper-toys, talking to
          her about enjoying the present and dancing forever. All of which would
          be wonderful.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I wish people could apply those teachings, Chatreya thought, because
          people came out of the trip having to go back to work in a system that
          depended on the destruction of everything, and the fantastic visions
          ended in just a curious story, years in the future, when the “once
          traveler” commented at a party with friends about the beings he had
          encountered. From this, and other totalizing experiences, she ended up
          feeding her new political current. Presentism.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          By the way, the monstrous being that had emerged from Balumian's
          building. Corp, was already rising in all its magnificence, and
          everyone in Jakarta was looking at it, if not out the window,
          everywhere on the news, and now walking at a slow pace through the
          Sudirman CBD, followed by a helicopter and a multitude of drones
          towards the north, as it would just pass by the national monument and
          the Istiqlal mosque. As if they were a tourist who is going to take a
          picture. And in its wake, heavily, like an invisible jelly that
          expands street by street, it left the air rarified, undulating, and
          the people stunned.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The team of mercenaries had no idea that they had been hired to end
          human civilization as we knew it. They dropped their weapons, they
          dropped themselves, they began to feel a violent cooking of hormones
          and neurotransmitters that led to an ecstatic paralysis. Presentism,
          the annals of history would say, was in its theory, ecstasy as a
          political alternative to a positivist developmentalism of market
          expansion. Instead of slaving away all of humanity to create a future
          that looked like Shanghai or Shenzhen, presentism attempted to show
          that that future already existed within us, and it is called ecstasy.
          That was what PIR produced, and the legion of monumental neon gods
          that would enter the earth, landing with the softness of a feather to
          see with a smile how the oil pipelines stopped working, the plastic
          stopped being manufactured, the production of iPhones stopped dead.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The same with the CO2, the cars stopped moving, the planes stopped
          flying, the Chinese factories stopped working, and everyone remained
          like idiots, smiling with pleasure. The contamination infected the
          mind, but, curiously, it seemed to spread even faster through
          electronic systems. Social networks, computers, cell phones, all went
          into ecstasy in unison. Microsoft Word vibrated in the present,
          Microsoft Edge manifested itself in meaningless jumps, Google Chrome
          crashed, restarted showing confused data, mixing up web sites with
          each other, Wikipedia with Xvideos.com, Zlibrary joined the Kuwait
          government page, ad infinitum, Facebook reused posts and profiles to
          create large musical mashups displaying fast deformed photographs and
          texts reorganized to look like pop songs. The machines had reached a
          spiritual dimension, reaching ecstasy, stasis, asis, sis. And although
          the physical effects were only initially felt on the island of Java,
          in just under a second they were felt in the rest of the planet, if
          you were a computer, that is.

          Sinn Chatreya descended from between the hoops of the Nexial Gate.
          Scientists, police, mercenaries, terrorists and anarcho-primitivists
          were all, not only perfectly fascinated by the visual effects that
          surrounded them, obsessively inspecting the things around them, others
          writhing on the ground from the waves of psychosexual pleasure, the
          men ejaculating in their pants. Not only that; they also suddenly
          found themselves hooked to an alien technology, famous across worlds,
          that connected gastric systems through the air. A kind of food WiFi.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Sinn approached Juno, trying to control the laughter that possessed
          her, and told him that she had ordered a large amount of the food
          dendrites from Plocomia 11, a faraway planet in hyperspace in which
          food, energy, and entropy are in a tightly controlled balance. In
          effect, the energy particles moved between trees, animals, and things.
          Labor as a means to accomplish nourishment is a thing of the past.
          Work itself has been abolished. Juno Luna laughed so hard he peed on
          his pants and then understood quite clearly that time was not a line
          in a singular direction from past to future. It was quite clear now
          that time was a spiral, spiraling into the present, of this, this
          thing here, this word you're reading here. And this dot.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Hey Juno.<br /><br />
          Actually, yes. Presentism is reversing that way of understanding time
          and concentrating on the present, in which the present itself is an
          endless abyss, and staying in that abyss to understand our reality. It
          is ecstasy and psychedelic trance as a political alternative.<br /><br />
          And what you asked me. Yes. I have been talking to the Eidolons,
          although the conversations don't make much sense if we translate them
          into our language. I know that you understand, I know that you know
          that what we live in is not sustainable and that no one is doing
          anything to stop it. You know it is urgent to stop it. We say it in
          the United Nations, we repeat it, we have been repeating it for
          decades, but no one is capable of changing it, because it's not
          profitable.<br /><br />
          And worst of all, they believe that we are terrorists. Tell me, who is
          the terrorist? Us or them, who destroy everything!<br /><br />

          I don't like what you're telling me. Ferals are terrorists. I'm not
          going to tell anyone, but I didn't work in the Nexial Gate to bring
          some unfathomable entity to bring chaos to the world. I did it to
          learn. To know and understand our universe. Plus, you're a little
          obsessed with environmentalism. Don't you think that in a few years,
          someone will invent something to replace plastic? Or that electric
          cars are going to replace gasoline cars very soon?<br /><br />

          Dear Dr.<br /><br />
          It has something to do with the tribe I'm related to in Colombia I
          told you about. They see time, not as a straight arrow that goes from
          past to future, but as a spiral, a spiral of the present continuous,
          in which everything is happening right now. It starkly contrasts with
          modernism and the ideology of progress. It's not that I don't agree
          with science, it's more like, the way “progress” and “development”
          work in our current society is all based on exponential economic
          growth, regardless of our finite resources. The future is more
          important than anything else, modernity is a project to never be
          completed, but the way it works now, it requires so much destruction
          to keep it going, that it doesn't make any sense to continue. The
          present is already rich enough, but we can't see it because we are
          already junkies to the system of future satisfaction and commodities.
          The gods of DMT have finally given us this solution, we met in this
          intergalactic session with representatives of a bunch of intelligent
          worlds, and they want to give us this gift. That's it. That's what
          presentism is.<br /><br />

          actually good, many people I know and love are also having good lives
          that are worthy and interesting. It seems a disaster to me that you
          cannot see life with optimism, and instead can only see the
          righteousness of environmentalism; it makes you think you're better
          than everyone else, doesn't it? You think you're a saint because you
          care about pollution and plastic, and cows. And you dare to make such
          a big decision for so many millions of people. You are not only going
          to stop pollution but the entire intellectual production, you have
          just put an end to art, to writing, to someone being able to enjoy a

          I woke up in the dark, feeling an intense pain in my left hand. I
          didn't even want to touch it. I crawled pathetically in the darkness
          of the deck to discover that something had pierced through the hull,
          emptied the ayahuasca emulsion, and contaminated everything with a
          bioluminescent liquid, which at first could barely be seen, but little
          by little It gave off such a shine that it let me see everything in
          great detail. The colossal eidolon had not only penetrated the mecha's
          chassis; it had contaminated it. It was an immense crawling nervous
          system or disembodied spinal cord, that writhed around inside my
          mecha, stretching its spinal nerves and branching inside the crusted
          fluxus. Interdimensional parasitism, I thought.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The same parasitism that had taken over the entire planet. I could
          barely move, but I could feel, not only the details of my body, the
          state of my mouth, the sweat that covered my face, the sound of my
          breathing. I also felt a kind of pleasure, waves of euphoria that
          escalated and spread through my toes, up to my genitals and my
          abdomen. I tried to move, holding back laughter and happy thoughts
          while at the same time feeling the pain in my arm. I looked for the
          exit, but the airlock was perfectly sealed, and the mechanical
          ejection lever was completely jammed. I was locked inside and could
          only wait for the hunger or the contaminated air to kill me.

          A sudden electrical discharge, possibly coming from the eidolon,
          produced a muscular spasm in the leg of the MAGELLAN; it hurt me, but
          at the same time it felt like a tickle. The systems were back in
          operation. The lights came back on, the broken screens showed noise,
          and I had some control over the robot's limbs. My mind slowly linked
          with the giant's mind, only to confirm that it was already infected. I
          breathed in and grasped the thick smell of the jungle: plants,
          humidity, animals, decomposition, and flowers.

          The omnidirectional vision system linked successfully with my optical

          long spikes sprang out of my back, several phosphorescent, bulging,
          and enormous lemon-green tumors had grown like a bloody proliferation
          of fungi from the mecha's face and neck, spheres colored in bright
          cyan and magenta protruded from the spaces between the armor and the
          skin, branches of the most ultramarine blue made me look like a living
          coral reef. It was clear that the effects had also infected the
          software, causing the screens to fill with bugs, the programming to go
          crazy, meaningless commands to be executed, rhythmic pulses to be
          played, almost like distorted electronic music.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Earth to base. Here MAGELLAN; Technician Luna in section 4.35, sector
          2b. Do you copy? R 34. My unit is still operative. Two other units
          were destroyed. Two pilots down, I'm injured.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I waited a while, then repeated the message. I finally heard several
          voices. At first, I was joyful, but then I knew something was wrong:
          the voices were not coming from the mecha communication system, but
          from my mind, and they were not in a human language. I was able to
          move the mecha. I rose heavily from the jungle, managing to put the
          machine back on its feet, and began to limp, now a semi-symbiotic
          entity, half-humanoid, half alienoid. I walked towards Jakarta,
          stumbling every so often, thinking that maybe I could still accomplish
          my mission and retrieve the Nexial Gate. I saw eidolons in the
          distance, rising like alien trees.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          They didn't look at me, they didn't look for me, and it didn't occur
          to them to face me in battle; they just stood tall, towering over the
          jungles of west Java, some walked heavily with no apparent direction
          or intention. I looked for human traces and it wasn't difficult to
          find them: remains of a rotten bridge, houses covered in vines, and
          finally the city. Kilometers of what once had been the slums of
          Jakarta, broken streets zigzagging endlessly, buildings covered in
          vines, spectacular trees growing from what had once been clusters of
          houses of South Tangerang, skyscrapers of the Surdiman area from which
          rivers poured wildly, what looked like shopping malls with worn
          surfaces covered in moss and lichen. I walked on top of abandoned
          stores and neighborhoods, my steps destroyed cars that lay almost
          petrified.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          It was only after half an hour of making my way through the city in
          something like a meditation, that I realized how strange it was that
          the mecha still had battery power. I looked for the maps on the
          navigation panels, but the computers had gone crazy, some of what the
          monitors showed in the optic nerve looked like software from the
          Diaspora, but opening in lotuses of icons, abstract tides of
          meaningless code, windows that opened and closed, maps, old websites
          showing tons of information about things I had never seen before.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          It felt like the mecha had gone psychotic, surfing anxiously through
          corrupted encyclopedias, databases, search engines, porn sites, bank
          or university websites at a maddening speed. I closed my eyes, tried
          to remember the maps that we had memorized since we were children in
          the Diaspora, and walked trying to find my way, recognizing parks or
          intersections of the city before getting lost again in my thoughts, in
          my present. Until I finally began to understand what I was getting
          into.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          In what had been ground zero of the infection years ago, the traces of
          a thousand battles became visible. I could see the craters, the
          collapsed buildings extending through large areas of ruins and
          desolation, and in the middle of it all rose the building of Balumian
          corp.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row6">
        <div class="small">
          The temple around which the Nexial Wars took place most intensely.
          Years ago, it had been a minimalist structure of concrete and curtain
          walls, but now a cluster of black basalt stood tall surrounded by
          rubble; a monument in the style of the Borobudur, made, we were told,
          by the eidolons, who enjoyed themselves in building large structures
          just like children love to build sandcastles.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          This devastation and silence were so different from what I had been
          told at school, in the diaspora. They repeated this image of the Feral
          City as a nest of violence, boiling with weapons and anger, aggressive
          abominations ready to kill anybody who approached this holy epicenter.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I was told they would shoot at me until there was nothing left but a
          pile of boiling organs. Well, perhaps the infection growing through my
          body made me invisible to the defense system, and I was already
          becoming one of them, but there didn't seem to be anyone in any of the
          large, ruined spaces. Not human beings, at least, just some birds and
          mammals.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I dismantled the pile of stones that replaced the building using only
          my infected right hand since the left one was still hurting so much.
          In the center of a square platform, on a cubic altar, were the two
          rings of the Nexial gate. So many years of war for something so small.
          It was no longer a simple smooth and polished pair of floating rings;
          the most diverse collection of extraterrestrial flora grew, spread and
          lived expanding from the rings off the Nexial Gate.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Only when I was face to face with that eccentric and baroque mixture
          of multicolored organisms did I notice that the eidolons that were
          patrolling or ruminating around the city had noticed me; not in a
          threatening way, just with curiosity. Then I heard something.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Kai, Kai, Kai? <br /><br />
          I can't say it was a single voice. Rather it felt like it was the
          biotic mass talking through a distorted radio that spoke directly to
          my mind.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I tried not to pay attention to the voices. I crouched down to get a
          better look and determine whether it would be possible to pry off the
          Nexial Gate with my fingers or whether I would need some tool to cut
          through the thick tangle of roots and branches so as not to break the
          precious artifact. The screens in the cockpit were still firing some
          psychotic images, codes, and text that showed the union between the
          diaspora internet and the dreamsphere. The screens suddenly began to
          tune to something different. Sounds and images connected strangely
          with my brain. Certain tones, palpitations, squares or circles,
          photographs of people I knew nothing about.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Your mother is with us.<br /><br />
          —Your father is with us.<br /><br />
          —Kai Luna.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row7">
        <div class="small">
          I stopped. I knew it could be a trap. The Nexial wars had been mostly
          fought in the mind, when prodigious eidolons made their way through
          the enemy camp, infecting the minds of everyone in waves of pleasure
          and pain, forcing them to agree to surrender and join the enemy.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Leftists, environmentalists, communists, indigenous peoples, and
          intellectuals of all sorts gradually joined the ferals. They told me
          it happened through the World Wide Web: the human internet was
          seriously infected, and databases had spilled and lost their order.
          Passwords, bank accounts, state secrets, everything was scattered
          randomly: videos, movies, books, scientific reports, forums, and
          social networks; the information empire was now weird. There were
          thousands of people connected to the network who began with
          convulsions, sardonic laughter, euphoria, and sexual ecstasy without
          any provocation. Soon people got lost in their own homes, beginning to
          obsess over the details of the things around them.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —We have all the files if you want to see them in detail.<br /><br />
          Feeling the waves of pleasure and presentism coursing through my
          nervous system, I had no choice but to grab the monitors with my fists
          and open my knuckles on the LED glass. The hypnosis stopped, or at
          least its effects were delayed. I closed my eyes, but the voices were
          still there.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —They lied to you. Kai. Your parents are not dead. We are here. I want
          you to see the conversations, papers, and reports, and see for
          yourself. We have stored human history, and its discoveries.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I operated the robot's right hand and produced a cannon that fired a
          sharp plasma beam, with which I used to cut the vines, roots, veins,
          fungal growths, and algae while doing my best to ignore what was
          happening around me. I focused intensely, cutting biomass around the
          frame of the artifact but at the same time beginning to feel the
          increase in the soporific and highly pleasurable effects of the
          dreamsphere, as it reached into my lungs and affected my central
          nervous system.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Now I could focus on details that I wouldn't have paid attention to
          before. The biological structures seemed to me to be masterpieces,
          extraordinary beings that I was destroying. I stopped. The feeling
          that those symmetrical bulbs, those colors and spots of such
          extraordinary shades of blue, purple and lilac gave me, was that they
          were part of my own body, and that, in that context, I was playing
          with the organs of an immense god. A god which I was also a part of.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Son. Kai. I'm Nafisa.<br /><br />
          Yes, of course. My mom. I was able to dissociate myself from the
          mecha's body for a second to notice that, inside the cockpit, the
          eidolon's filaments were beginning to touch my body. On my hands and
          legs, branches of the alien nervous system that filled the deck had
          bitten me like leeches, attached themselves to my body, injecting some
          substance to drug me and binding me to the creature. I started to
          stir, trying to remove the white veins one by one, tear them out, and
          cut them with my teeth.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Oh yeah, mimicking my parents. I was expecting you to do something of
          the sort, how predictable. —I said, a little to myself. I didn't want
          to respond to the voices that were playing with my head. It was my
          years of training to try not to pay attention.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row8">
        <div class="small">
          I continued cutting away at the vines and roots, ignoring comments
          that still seemed ghostly and meaningless, yet strangely familiar. I
          also noticed that the eidolons were approaching curiously, moving in
          their colorful monstrosity, surrounding me. I thought maybe if I
          talked to them I could distract them while I continued at my job.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —The eidolons are nothing more than colonizers. And they killed you,
          mom.<br /><br />
          —No. No. No. —the voices responded. —Course correction. Correction.
          Course correction.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —We had a beautiful life on Earth. And you expelled us from our
          home.<br /><br />
          —Humans don't have a beautiful life on Earth. Those who have, based on
          the suffering of millions of other life beings.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          An eidolon in front of me began to mutate, between contractions, and
          strange movements, with lumps inflating and limbs definitively joining
          together, it acquired the shape of a gigantic human. A naked,
          multicolored woman. My mother. At its side, another eidolon went
          through a similar process, until becoming my father. Juno Luna.<br /><br />
          I paused in my task for a second and looked at my parents' naked
          bodies, albeit in deep reds and neon blues.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —I missed you so much, baby. Now it's hard to understand that things
          were not always like this, but Juno was already in the dreamsphere
          when it happened, he was in Jakarta at the epicenter of everything
          when it happened. And when you were born.<br /><br />
          —Yes, the Ferals kidnapped him —said I.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —No one kidnapped me. I was the one who gave all the intelligence to
          Chatreya to enter Balumian.<br /><br />
          It had to be a lie. That's not what Peter told me. Peter told me…
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Peter didn't want you to know the truth. Also, at this point, we
          don't know if he is your father or not. Or if it's me. —The eidolon
          shaped like my father laughed. —We loved each other. The three of us.
          We were a family.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —But Peter ended up protecting capitalists, companies, transnational
          corporations, and powerful people.

      </div>

      <div class="row9">
        <div class="small">
          Fleshy lumps of biological matter grew on my body, vines, roots, and
          nerves stretched out and grabbed my hands. I struggled in the cockpit,
          and the mecha began to move irregularly. Something grabbed my leg. As
          I turned to tear off whatever I had there, another mass clung to the
          mecha's face.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The eidolon that had infected the mecha was taking control of its
          movement, and taking over the vital systems of the machinery, it even
          seemed to be rearranging the internal systems, and mechanisms,
          discarding servomotors or appropriating the thorium reactor. I backed
          away trying to regain control, using whatever strength I had left in
          my right hand to hit my bump-infected face with repeated blows, and I
          tried to tear the tentacles off.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The mecha fell to the ground with me inside, together we wallowed in a
          sea of colorful lichens, surrounded by strange eidolons that looked at
          me with curiosity. In the deck, the nerves were beginning to connect
          to my face. I struggled with the vines, splashing bioluminescent
          liquid, ripping something off just as something else grabbed my arm,
          or my foot.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Nerves, branches, and veins were entering through the holes in my
          body, I felt them writhing in my genitals, and in my anus, they played
          with my ears, they grabbed my hands and my face, and they touched my
          gums and my teeth. And I no longer had the energy to continue the
          struggle.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The robot's intestines were emptied, the internal organs completely
          removed and exchanged for other things, an arm was torn off, which
          hurt me immensely and I screamed through the luminous liquid. The
          infected lymph pumped presentism into my bloodstream. The nerves of my
          own body began to move inside me, like transparent worms.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Calm down, baby. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Let yourself
          go.<br /><br />
          There was no point in fighting. I stayed still, breathing heavily,
          trying not to drown.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Just look around you. Think about the places you have traveled on
          this planet and tell me if it would be best to build a shopping mall
          here, or a company where people must work for eight hours every day,
          and garbage over there. That's what the diaspora wants. No?
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          When I opened my eyes, the eidolon that was my mother was lulling me
          to sleep.<br /><br />
          —Open your nerves, — she whispered in my mind.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row10">
        <div class="small">
          As if it were a basic human technique or movement that I had
          completely forgotten, I moved something inside my body, like the way
          your throat moves or that secret muscle in your inner ear. Then my
          nerves began to push their way out of my body. It wasn't painful. The
          nerves spread out of my face, out of my hands and my legs, growing
          gently like a little plant.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Maybe I didn't care much about my own body anymore. Maybe I didn't
          care much about my own life anymore. I could only feel the granular
          pleasure of living in the present. My body expanded from being a tiny
          thing, occupying the entire size of the pilot capsule, joining with
          cancerous lumps, igneous fungi, mystical organs, stomachs and
          esophagus of beings from other dimensions until I became my own mecha.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The “I” became the monster. It became clear that the eidolons, the
          extraterrestrials, were made of thousands of people who had attached
          themselves at some point to an alien core more or less voluntarily.
          Humanity was evolving into something new. A symbiogenesis in which
          aliens and we were a new type of life form, just like mitochondria and
          single cells had become eukaryotes; evolutionary changes were
          happening rapidly, and we would soon become new thousands of living
          beings.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Bubbly minds greeted me: people who decades ago would have identified
          as Colombian or Australian, male or female, now seemed more like
          shapeless masses of light. They had not thereby lost their
          individuality, nor did they completely coexist as a single being, or
          an almost theological entity. Rather they existed in a stream of
          consciousness between being one and being multitudes.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I felt Mom's hug, and Dad's hug. Only they were no longer hugs, but
          hot nodes of nerves clinging and squeezing each other, exchanging
          telepathic information. And I felt the love they had for Peter. They
          missed him, they wanted to have settled that dispute in a hug and
          love. But Peter was not prepared to leave behind his middle-class life
          with a good salary. It seemed too radical to end the sources of air
          pollution because he liked to travel by plane, he was an Apple fan and
          he dreamed of buying a Tesla that could drive itself.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          When I opened my eyes, I no longer saw like a human, with two frontal
          eyes facing a single direction. There were tiny clusters of eyes that
          covered my entire body, giving me vision much more complicated than
          stereoscopic vision.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          There's no future. I stand in my hundred-meter height, noticing that I
          have lost the limits that make up the anthropomorphic figure of the
          robot. Metallic parts fall thunderously like shells while my limbs
          multiply. I look one last time at the Nexial Gateway. I can spend
          hours looking at it, exploring every detail, smelling every detail. It
          is an endless abyss, I can delve and delve and delve into the present,
          one thought leads to another, and another. And every thought is the
          present itself.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I feel waves of pleasure, pulling tendons somewhere in my neck and
          legs. I am perfectly aware of my nervous system, every sensation
          deserves to be explored. If I prefer, I can also explore my own
          emotions with the same psychedelic concentration; I can immerse myself
          in my ideas, my concepts, my fears. I can communicate them to others
          without the anxiety of the future, and we can, together, analyze and
          understand each other. The aliens, who have become our backbones, seem
          to orchestrate in-person activities. Dances? Games? Do you walk to
          distant places to delight in what exists?

          When I think that that's it, that what remains of the rest of my
          existence is summarized in wandering aimlessly through the immensity
          of the planet (which is quite a lot considering that we could spend
          eternity watching how the clouds or the water move), I discover new
          ways of existing.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I have lived for (months?) wandering between jungles and continents,
          coming across ruins of human cities by surprise, curiously observing
          small windows towards individual rooms, ruined stairs, and static cars
          among the greenery. I hear stories from those who lived there, part of
          the immense network system. I take strides across the ocean and am
          amazed by volcanoes, I dive and swim, I cross a desert, a wasteland, a
          medieval citadel.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          When I remember again that there was such a thing as a “Nexial gate”.
          An alien prepares me for my first jump.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Maybe you don't notice it, but you have a Nexial gate inside you. We
          all have a machine capable of crossing intergalactic distances in
          consciousness. Consciousness itself is an intergalactic portal.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          A group of eidolons perform the necessary steps of a small dance or
          ritual. Torrents of dimethyltryptamine activate tunnels, surrounded by
          petals of light. The doors between worlds open like flowers. We can
          explore other maps, sometimes we cross them without realizing it while
          appreciating the shape of a fish.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          That's what it was about all along. To expand the exploration
          platforms, and wander in the tides of the present. Walk without
          waiting for a destination, create without thinking of the result, live
          without thinking about death, success, growth, development, progress,
          profits, the future, old age, tomorrow, a better tomorrow, or a worse
          yesterday, there is no past, there is no beginning, there are no
          centuries before Christ, there is no remote prehistoric world. There
          is only the now. The present is this phrase. This phrase. This phrase.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          So I crossed to Valtiklar, without realizing it. I have always been in
          Valtiklar, we are the very elves of DMT, and we walk through worlds
          more fluorescent than Earth. I am now on Zumia Exis. It's a mostly
          yellow world, and we are surrounded by shifting polygons that are
          siblings, friends, mothers, or a reflective mirror of ourselves.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Aliens from various universes have flooded the Earth, but we have also
          invaded theirs. I learn to become a polygon. You have always been a
          geometric solid. Learn to fractalize yourself, factor yourself by a
          prime number. I am in a world where the concept of food does not
          exist. I'm living in a planetary stomach. I am in a ship of neon
          technology and the gods teach me to fragment myself, to reorganize
          myself. All this, of course, upholstered in repetitions of the manual
          to create a Nexial door, to help others reach the same top
          development, the omega point of galactic civilization.

          I see a human entering Plocomia 11. He has entered with a neon suit.
          He's high on Dimethyltryptamine. There are several of us who see him,
          amazed at the changing tides of mandelbulbs, of self-replicating
          figures, fractaloids that implode cyclically, several of us want to
          greet him.

        <div class="small">
          —Peter?<br /><br />
          But Peter doesn't understand me. I can hardly tell you how happy I am
          to see you.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Peter. I miss you a lot. I want to show you all the hyper toys we
          have here.<br /><br />
          Peter seems to recognize me. Maybe? Maybe he can see me? Maybe he's
          here to transcribe the manual. If he manages to build a Nexial gate
          again he could come with me permanently. I will show you the code. I
          open polygonal hyper-signifiers, transparent objects full of code.
          Copy it fast, Pete, come meet me soon.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —I'm glad you managed to integrate. —He seems to want to hug me.<br /><br />
          I jump inside his holographic body, trying to show him my love, I take
          him by the hand through the immense geographies of Aktum. Peter,
          Peter, I miss you. I love you. Why don't you come with us. He seemed
          to want to say goodbye. Then he explained in his human language that
          he had to leave now and just wanted to make sure I was okay.
          Immediately he became a ball of light that streaked the sky of Aktum.

          —No one tells you what happens with Peter? —an electric blue eidolon
          who saw everything from afar asked me.<br /><br />
          —No one tells.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Peter doesn't want the regular human way of life to disappear. He
          believes that there is intrinsic value in individual experience and
          that perhaps in something they call “the future” they find another way
          to develop their civilization without all the destruction. There is a
          pact. A pact between him and us.

        <div class="small">
          When the Nexial Wars are nearing their end, Peter Yao is having a DMT
          ritual. In it he is addressing us, and asking us to stop the humans
          from taking the Nexial Gate into space. Why do humans want that? Agh,
          they're stupid.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          They think they can bring warmonger eidolons from the Salvia Divinorum
          to fight a new round of Nexial wars. Nobody believes him in the space
          colonies, but it is true. If they take the door to the Diaspora, what
          remains of humanity is also the present. We accept. That's why we
          don't let them take the Gateway. To honor Peter Yao. That's why
          Eidolons fight on Earth against giant robots.

      </div>

      <div class="row13">
        <div class="small">
          —But then why does he want to make me fight on Earth?
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          —Because I'm feeling guilty. He is stealing you from your parents.
          Your parents ask many times to return you, and he wants to return you.
          In dreams, on DMT or ayahuasca surfing mode. He knows you can be
          integrated in symbiogenesis and be happy.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Lined up, pressed against the windows of the observation deck in the
          smelly and dilapidated space station where I grew up, the history
          teacher forced us to take a good look at “the green and blue beauty of
          Planet Earth” surrounded by hundreds of other space stations like
          ours, entire countries made of steel and ugly solar panels that looked
          like space garbage.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          The teacher and others repeated it to us every chance they could, with
          resentment, fear, and hunger: “Take a good look at where we come from,
          and where we need to return to. Those cursed fundamentalists expelled
          us from paradise. That's where the resources are! The minerals, the
          trees, and life itself. “You can't even imagine how beautiful those
          landscapes are.” Then we would return to class in a sad line, to talk,
          as usual, about the Nexial Wars for control of the gate.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          After classes, I returned, through the compartments of the central
          hallway, to my father's room. Like many, Peter Yao was a fallen man in
          the pandemic of mental health; it was I who had to feed him and take
          care of him. I forced him to bathe, to continue his little routines,
          and brush his teeth. He was tormented by those he left, especially
          Juno and Nafisa; my other parents, according to what he told me.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Dad had been a science celebrity, he even kept the articles that had
          been written about his work. However, after the great migration, he
          began a process of degeneration, in which he barely managed to raise
          me, but by the time I was fifteen, the role had been completely
          reversed.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          During much of that time, he had tried to convince the authorities not
          to attack Earth. He spoke ill of the Columbian-Fluxus program, which
          had been sold to the public as the only way to effectively combat
          aliens and re-take our land, by building giant robots in space from
          cloned eidolons; but he fought even harder to stop them from bringing
          the Nexial Gate to the space stations of the diaspora.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          Nobody paid attention to him, the scientific authorities were sure
          that they could use the door to bring beings from other dimensions,
          perhaps some more malevolent, like the demons found during bad trips
          with anticholinergics like datura or DMX, dark lords from the crystal
          meth universe, or the gods of the Salvia; entities or cosmic jesters,
          which, scientists believed, we could instrumentalize to produce a new
          Nexial war between gods from different worlds to re-colonize Earth.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row14">
        <div class="small">
          When I confessed to Peter that I wanted to enlist in the
          Columbian-Fluxus program, he looked at me with some sadness, and he
          did mention Juno and Nafisa.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          He had told me how both were killed by the Ferals during the war, and
          only with luck had he been able to rescue me during the expansion of
          the dreamsphere; perhaps it made sense to seek revenge.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          He didn't say much more, but he also didn't ask me not to.
        </div>
        <div class="small">Maybe he knew something else.</div>
        <div class="small">
          Sometimes he would inject DMT in his room and wouldn't tell me what he
          had seen.
        </div>
        <div class="small">
          I finally said goodbye to him, got into the military program, and got
          pretty good at synchronization in the mind-machine coupler.

          Grown into a man, with muscles and all, papa Yao hugged me one last
